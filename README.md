# Piano-Stairs
Embedded Systems package

Idea behind the project:
    In the current world, people prefer elevators and escalators over a flight of stairs. But, climbing stairs comes with add on health benefits like keeping the body fit and energetic. So, for more people to take up climbing stairs, we decided to develop a project that would make it a fun and exciting experience for them and thus came up with the idea of "PIANO STAIRS".

Implementation:
    This package is done using Raspberry Pi and implemented in Python, in which we used Laser lights to illuminate the IR sensors present on each stair. When a person is climbing the stairs, the field of view of the IR sensors are obstructed, triggering a piano note that plays. Subsequent obstructiins leads to multiple piano notes to play, thereby making the staircase an exciting musical experience.
